lifx4fun
========

Some JavaScript to control my four LIFX bulbs. If you don't have exactly four bulbs, this won't do much for you unless you do some editing.

This is built off of the demos from [https://github.com/magicmonkey/lifxjs](github.com/magicmonkey/lifxjs). It currently uses [my fork](https://github.com/SSteve/lifxjs) of the project which adds a status request to the bulb object.

Installation is a bit of a mess at the moment. Basically install **node.js**, make sure **lifx.js** and **lifx4fun.js** are in the same folder, and start the program with the command `node lifx4fun.js`. I'll try to clean it up later. Right now I'm trying to get ready for family to come up for Xmas.

I've never written JavaScript before so I'm sure I'm breaking lots of rules.
